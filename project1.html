      <h3>Intro</h3>
      <p>Fund Space was a group week project that incorporates the creative UI design & development  with the object-oriented C# language.
      Fund Space is a web application that allows a user to create, view, and donate to campaigns to help a certain cause. We used popular crowdfunding apps like Kick Starter and Go Fund Me to use as references throughout the project and declared the Home Page, User Profile, and Campaign pages as our minimum viable product (MVP). Fund Space is meant to be run on a Windows computer.</p>
